AP Statistics Units 1-4 Program for TI-84
Overview

This program is designed for students in the AP Statistics course at Stratford. It covers essential concepts from Units 1 through 4, providing tools and formulas for analyzing data, interpreting results, and understanding statistical relationships. The program is specifically tailored for the TI-84 calculator, making it a practical resource for in-class and exam preparation.
Features
Graphing

    Labeling Graphs:
        Title (at the top)
        X-axis label (with units)
        Y-axis label (with units)
        X-axis ticks
        Y-axis ticks
        BOOM! (plot data)

Describing Graphs

    Categorical Graphs:
        W's (Who, What, Where, When, Why)
        Most frequent category
        Least frequent category
        Aha! (Interesting observations)

    Quantitative Distributions:
        W's (Who, What, Where, When, Why)
        Center (mean, median)
        Unusual observations
        Shape (normal, skewed)
        Spread (range, interquartile range)

Statistical Interpretations

    Standard Deviation:
        The standard deviation (# and units) is the typical distance a (context) is away from the mean (context).

    Association Between Variables:
        “WHAT’s the FUD!?!” (Form, Unusual, Direction, Strength)
        As x increases, y seems to increase/decrease.

    Slope Interpretation:
        For every 1 x-unit in the x, there is a predicted slope y-units increase/decrease in the y.

    Y-Intercept Interpretation:
        When x is 0 units, the predicted y is y-int y-units.

    Correlation Coefficient (r):
        The correlation coefficient r shows a direction, strength linear relationship between x and y.

    Coefficient of Determination (r²):
        ?% of the variation in y can be explained by a linear relationship with x.

    Standard Deviation of Residuals:
        The standard deviation of the residuals (# and units) is the typical distance a (y-context) is away from the predicted (y-context).

Sampling Bias

    Types of Bias:
        Convenience Bias
        Voluntary Response Bias
        Undercoverage
        Nonresponse Bias
        Response Bias

Sampling Methods

    Simple Random Sample:
        Assign numbers 1 to size of population
        Use identical slips in a “magic hat” for selection

    Systematic Random Sample:
        Randomly choose a starting point
        Apply a systematic approach to select every _n_th person/place/thing

    Cluster Random Sample:
        Choose a random location/group and survey all within that cluster.

    Stratified Random Sample:
        Divide into strata and perform SRS within each stratum.

Calculator Functions

    Statistical Functions:
        Stat -> List Editing
        2nd -> Stat Plot
        Zoom 9 (Zoom Stat)
        Zoom 6 (ZStandard)
        Stat -> Calc -> 1-Var Stats
        2nd-> Distr -> normalcdf(left, right)
        2nd-> Distr -> invNorm(percentile)

    Regression Analysis:
        Stat -> Calc -> 8: LinReg(a + bx)
        2nd -> List -> 8: RESID
        Enable diagnostics: Mode -> Stat Diagnostics -> ON

    Probability Simulation:
        Access via: apps -> Prob Sim

Formulae

    Z-score:
    Z=(x−mean)std
    Z=std(x−mean)​

    Residual Calculation:
    Residual=Y−y^
    Residual=Y−y^​

    Where YY is the actual value and y^y^​ is the predicted value.

Conclusion

This program serves as a comprehensive guide to essential statistical concepts and tools for students studying AP Statistics at Stratford. It facilitates learning and application of statistical methods on the TI-84 calculator, empowering students to excel in their coursework.
